    "You will be creating a model that creates the layout of ships at the begining of each game. The following will describe the rules of your endpoint and the following notebook will show the details of implementing your endpoint. This repo has code implementing a basic layout endpoint, it will choose 5 random points and then place another ship to the right of each of those 5 points. \n",
